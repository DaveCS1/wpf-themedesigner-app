## Overview
The DevExpress WPF Theme Designer was designed to reduce the grunt work associated with custom app-wide theme development. It is a free standalone tool that allows you to generate custom themes by altering the base colors of existing DevExpress WPF Themes.

## Features
* [Theme Customization](https://docs.devexpress.com/WpfThemeDesigner/119320/workspace/tools) <br/> The Theme Designer offers a number of features designed to improve your editing experience. Pick colors from any on-screen application, filter element colors and use other new tools to easily colorize any visual element of your application.

* [Palette](https://docs.devexpress.com/WpfThemeDesigner/400319/edit-colors) <br/> The latest DevExpress Themes contain a palette. 

* [XAML Edit](https://docs.devexpress.com/WpfThemeDesigner/400298/edit-theme-in-xaml) <br/> The WPF Theme Designer empowers you to locate and modify control templates, styles and apply color presets. You can edit XAML files in the built-in Code View, or open the theme solution in Visual Studio.

* Live Preview <br/> Flexibility is at the heart of our WPF Theme Designer. Once you've made your changes, you don't need to rebuild your entire project to view the result. A comprehensive set of previews and an ability to preview changes in control and demo views give you complete picture of your theme's appearance. Simply use the Designer's Preview window to evaluate the usability of your new Theme.

* [Import. Export. Share.](https://docs.devexpress.com/WpfThemeDesigner/118787/build-and-export-new-themes) <br/> The WPF Theme Designer ships with multiple options to save modified themes and retain them for later use. New themes can be built as assemblies or saved to a *.tdsln file. All changes made to individual color schemes remain consistent whenever you upgrade to a newer version of DevExpress WPF Controls.
